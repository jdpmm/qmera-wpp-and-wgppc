# WGPP - Programming language

This is the continuation of my first ["programming language"](https://github.com/jdpmm/wgdi) which is interpreted, but i wanna go beyond it, and make a better programming language, so this is my compiled programming language.
Every assembly code will be saved at `./src/out`

## Done/Semi-done (if that exists)
- [x] Search tokens
- [x] Many instructions at the same line (; is the delimiter)
- [x] Check semicolon at the end of every line
- [x] Integer variable by number `int $x$ = 4;`
- [x] Integer by arithmetic operation `int $y$ = ARITH(4 add 12);`
- [x] Negative numbers

## TODO
- [ ] `exit` function (3/?)
- [ ] `wout` function (3/?)
- [ ] Functions to print `wout and printf` (1/2)
- [ ] Copy values among variables with if it's possible (1/?)
- [ ] Arithmetic (1/2)
- [ ] Integer variables
- [ ] Character variables
- [ ] Execution arguments
- [ ] Pointer variables
- [ ] Stdin
- [ ] A lot of another stuffs!!!
