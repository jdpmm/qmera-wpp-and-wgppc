# WGPP Programming Language

The WG++ programming language is a better version of my first "programming language" wgdi, wgdi isn't a Turing Complete so i don't think that could be considered a Programming language and is so slow.
WGPP born when i knew the assembly programming language and i said "Tremendo, esto es una chimba" and i thought i gotta make something with this.

The main idea of wgpp is that could be a programming language (Turing Complete) to make some data structures and have some of fun (To me, might be to someone else), on this moment (15-02-2022) i've been writing all files again since i had one problem (Bad C++ practices) and one mistake (i deleted all files, but i don't had one copy). Only for love and fun.

## Things to do
* [x] Ignore comments
* [x] printf function (Still isn't complete, but already is working)
* [ ] Check semicolon token at the end of every line
* [ ] A lot of more stuffs
